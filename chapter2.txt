Theme: From Molecules to Ecosystems, Interactions Are Important in Biological Systems INTERACTIONS At any level of the biological hierarchy, interactions between the components of the system ensure smooth integration of all the parts, such that they function as a whole. This holds true equally well for molecules in a cell and the components of an ecosystem; we’ll look at both as examples.  Molecules: Interactions Within Organisms At lower levels of organization, the interactions between components that make up living organisms—organs, tissues, cells, and molecules—are crucial to their smooth operation. Consider the regulation of blood sugar level, for instance. Cells in the body must match the supply of fuel (sugar) to demand, regulating the opposing processes of sugar breakdown and storage. The key is the ability of many biological processes to self-regulate by a mechanism called feedback.  In feedback regulation, the output or product of a process regulates that very process. The most common form of regulation in living systems is negative feedback, a loop in which the response reduces the initial stimulus. As seen in the example of insulin signaling (Figure 1.10), after a meal the level of the sugar glucose in your blood rises, which stimulates cells of the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin, in turn, causes body cells to take up glucose and liver cells to store it, thus decreasing the blood glucose level. This eliminates the stimulus for insulin secretion, shutting off the pathway. Thus, the output of the process (insulin) negatively regulates that process.  Figure 1.10 Feedback regulation.  Figure 1.10 Full Alternative Text VISUAL SKILLS In this example, what is the response to insulin? What is the initial stimulus that is reduced by the response? Though less common than processes regulated by negative feedback, there are also many biological processes regulated by positive feedback, in which an end product speeds up its own production. The clotting of your blood in response to injury is an example. When a blood vessel is damaged, structures in the blood called platelets begin to aggregate at the site. Positive feedback occurs as chemicals released by the platelets attract more platelets. The platelet pileup then initiates a complex process that seals the wound with a clot.  Ecosystems: An Organism’s Interactions with Other Organisms and the Physical Environment At the ecosystem level, every organism interacts with other organisms. For instance, an acacia tree interacts with soil microorganisms associated with its roots, insects that live on it, and animals that eat its leaves and fruit (Figure 1.11). Interactions between organisms include those that are mutually beneficial (as when cleaner fish” eat small parasites on a turtle) and those in which one species benefits and the other is harmed (as when a lion kills and eats a zebra). In some interactions between species, both are harmed—for example, when two plants compete for a soil resource that is in short supply. Interactions among organisms help regulate the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole.  Figure 1.11 Interactions of an African acacia tree with other organisms and the physical environment.  Figure 1.11 Full Alternative Text Each organism also interacts continuously with physical factors in its environment. The leaves of a tree, for example, absorb light from the sun, take in carbon dioxide from the air, and release oxygen to the air (see Figure 1.11). The environment is also affected by organisms. For instance, in addition to taking up water and minerals from the soil, the roots of a plant break up rocks as they grow, contributing to the formation of soil. On a global scale, plants and other photosynthetic organisms have generated all the oxygen in the atmosphere.  Like other organisms, we humans interact with our environment. Our interactions sometimes have dire consequences: For example, over the past 150 years, humans have greatly increased the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas). This practice releases large amounts of carbon dioxide <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></math> and other gases into the atmosphere, causing heat to be trapped close to Earth’s surface (see Figure 56.29). Scientists calculate that the <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> added to the atmosphere by human activities has increased the average temperature of the planet by about <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mtext>°</mtext><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></math> since 1900.

This ongoing global warming is a major aspect of climate change, a directional change to the global climate that lasts for three decades or more (as opposed to short-term changes in the weather). But global warming is not the only way the climate is changing: Wind and precipitation patterns are also shifting, and extreme weather events such as storms and droughts are occurring more often. Climate change has already affected organisms and their habitats all over the planet. For example, polar bears have lost much of the ice platform from which they hunt, leading to food shortages and increased mortality rates. As habitats deteriorate, hundreds of plant and animal species are shifting their ranges to more suitable locations—but for some, there is insufficient suitable habitat, or they may not be able to migrate quickly enough. As a result, the populations of many species are shrinking in size or even disappearing (Figure 1.12). (For more examples of how climate change is affecting life on Earth, see Make Connections Figure 56.30.) Figure 1.12 Threatened by global warming.  The loss of populations due to climate change can ultimately result in extinction, the permanent loss of a species. As we’ll explore in greater detail in Concept 56.4, the consequences of these changes for humans and other organisms may be profound.  Having considered four of the unifying themes (organization, information, energy and matter, and interactions), let’s now turn to evolution. There is consensus among biologists that evolution is the core theme of biology, and it is discussed in detail in the next section.  Concept Check 1.1: The study of life reveals unifying themes 1. Starting with the molecular level in Figure 1.3, write a sentence that includes components from the previous (lower) level of biological organization, for example: “A molecule consists of atoms bonded together.” Continue with organelles, moving up the biological hierarchy.  2.

WHAT IF? For each theme discussed in this section, give an example not mentioned in the text.  For suggested answers, see Appendix A.
Concept 1.2 The Core Theme: Evolution accounts for the unity and diversity of life EVOLUTION An understanding of evolution helps us to make sense of everything we know about life on Earth. As the fossil record clearly shows, life has been evolving for billions of years, resulting in a vast diversity of past and present organisms. But along with the diversity there is also unity, in the form of shared features. For example, while sea horses, jackrabbits, hummingbirds, and giraffes all look very different, their skeletons are organized in the same basic way.  The scientific explanation for the unity and diversity of organisms is evolution: a process of biological change in which species accumulate differences from their ancestors as they adapt to different environments over time. Thus, we can account for differences between two species (diversity) with the idea that certain heritable changes occurred after the two species diverged from their common ancestor. However, they also share certain traits (unity) simply because they have descended from a common ancestor. An abundance of evidence of different types supports the occurrence of evolution and the mechanisms that describe how it takes place, which we’ll explore in detail in Chapters 22, 23, 24 and 25. To quote one of the founders of modern evolutionary theory, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” To understand this statement, we need to examine how biologists think about the vast diversity of life on the planet.
Classifying the Diversity of Life Diversity is a hallmark of life. Biologists have so far identified and named about 1.8 million species of organisms. Each species is given a two-part name: The first part is the name of the genus (plural, genera) to which the species belongs, and the second part is unique to the species within the genus. (For example, Homo sapiens is the name of our species.) To date, known species include at least 100,000 species of fungi, 290,000 plant species, 57,000 vertebrate species (animals with backbones), and 1 million insect species (more than half of all known forms of life)—not to mention the myriad types of single-celled organisms. Researchers identify thousands of additional species each year. Estimates of the total number of species range from about 10 million to over 100 million. Whatever the actual number, the enormous variety of life gives biology a very broad scope. Biologists face a major challenge in attempting to make sense of this variety.  The Three Domains of Life Humans tend to group diverse items according to their similarities and relationships to each other. Consequently, biologists have long used careful comparisons of structure, function, and other obvious features to classify forms of life into groups. In the last few decades, new methods of assessing species relationships, such as comparisons of DNA sequences, have led to a reevaluation of the classification of life. Although this reevaluation is ongoing, biologists currently place all organisms into three groups called domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (Figure 1.13).  Figure 1.13 The three domains of life.  The three domains of life are given. Figure 1.13 Full Alternative Text Two of the three domains—Bacteria and Archaea—consist of single-celled prokaryotic organisms. All the eukaryotes (organisms with eukaryotic cells) are in domain Eukarya. This domain includes four subgroups: kingdom Plantae, kingdom Fungi, kingdom Animalia, and the protists. The three kingdoms are distinguished partly by their modes of nutrition: Plants produce their own sugars and other food molecules by photosynthesis, fungi absorb nutrients in dissolved form from their surroundings, and animals obtain food by eating and digesting other organisms. Animalia is, of course, the kingdom to which we belong.  The most numerous and diverse eukaryotes are the protists, which are mostly single-celled organisms. Although protists were once placed in a single kingdom, they are now classified into several groups. One major reason for this change is the recent DNA evidence showing that some protists are less closely related to other protists than they are to plants, animals, or fungi.  Unity in the Diversity of Life As diverse as life is, there is also remarkable unity among forms of life. Consider, for example, the similar skeletons of different animals and the universal genetic language of DNA (the genetic code), both mentioned earlier. In fact, similarities between organisms are evident at all levels of the biological hierarchy. For example, unity is obvious in many features of cell structure, even among distantly related organisms (Figure 1.14).  Figure 1.14 An example of unity underlying the diversity of life: the architecture of cilia in eukaryotes.  Cilia are compared. Cilia (singular, cilium) are extensions of cells that function in locomotion. They occur in eukaryotes as diverse as Paramecium (found in pond water) and humans. Even organisms so different share a common architecture for their cilia, which have an elaborate system of tubules that is striking in cross-sectional views.  Figure 1.14 Full Alternative Text How can we account for life’s dual nature of unity and diversity? The process of evolution, explained next, illuminates both the similarities and differences in the world of life. It also introduces another important dimension of biology: the passage of time. The history of life, as documented by fossils and other evidence, is the saga of an ever-changing Earth billions of years old, inhabited by an evolving cast of living forms (Figure 1.15).  Figure 1.15 Studying the history of life.  Researchers reconfigure a skeleton. Researchers in South Africa reconstruct skeletons of Homo naledi, an extinct relative of Homo sapiens. The fossils were discovered in an underground cave that may have been a burial chamber.
Charles Darwin and the Theory of Natural Selection An evolutionary view of life came into sharp focus in November 1859, when Charles Darwin published one of the most important and influential books ever written, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (Figure 1.16). The Origin of Species articulated two main points. The first point was that, as species adapt to different environments over time, they accumulate differences from their ancestors. Darwin called this process descent with modification.” This insightful phrase captured the duality of life’s unity and diversity—unity in the kinship among species that descended from common ancestors and diversity in the modifications that evolved as species branched from their common ancestors (Figure 1.17). Darwin’s second main point was his proposal that “natural selection” is a primary cause of descent with modification.  Figure 1.16 Charles Darwin.  A portrait of Darwin next to a copy of The Origins of Species. The portrait shows Darwin in about 1840, well before the 1859 publication of his revolutionary book, commonly referred to as The Origin of Species.  Figure 1.17 Unity and diversity among birds.  Four different species of birds. These four birds are variations on a common body plan. For example, each has feathers, a beak, and wings. However, these common features are highly specialized for the birds’ diverse lifestyles.  Figure 1.17 Full Alternative Text Darwin developed his theory of natural selection from observations that by themselves were neither new nor profound. However, although others had described the pieces of the puzzle, it was Darwin who saw how they fit together. He started with the following three observations from nature: First, individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable (passed on from parents to offspring). Second, a population can produce far more offspring than can survive to produce offspring of their own. With more individuals than the environment is able to support, competition is inevitable. Third, species generally are suited to their environments—in other words, they are adapted to their circumstances. For instance, a common adaptation among birds that eat hard seeds is an especially strong beak.  By making inferences from these three observations, Darwin developed a scientific explanation for how evolution occurs. He reasoned that individuals with inherited traits that are better suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than less well-suited individuals. Over many generations, a higher and higher proportion of individuals in a population will have the advantageous traits. Evolution occurs as the unequal reproductive success of individuals ultimately leads to adaptation to their environment, as long as the environment remains the same.  Darwin called this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation natural selection because the natural environment consistently “selects” for the propagation of certain traits among naturally occurring variant traits in the population. The example in Figure 1.18 illustrates the ability of natural selection to “edit” an insect population’s heritable variations in coloration. We see the products of natural selection in the exquisite adaptations of various organisms to the special circumstances of their way of life and their environment. The wings of the bat shown in Figure 1.19 are an excellent example of adaptation.  Figure 1.18 Natural selection.  Natural selection amongst a beetle population. This imaginary beetle population has colonized a locale where the soil has been blackened by a recent brush fire. Initially, the population varies extensively in the inherited coloration of the individuals, from very light gray to charcoal. For hungry birds that prey on the beetles, it is easiest to spot the beetles that are lightest in color.  Figure 1.18 Full Alternative Text DRAW IT Over time, the soil will gradually become lighter in color. Draw another step to show how the soil, when lightened to medium color, would affect natural selection. Write a caption for this new step 5. Then explain how the population would change over time as the soil becomes lighter.
